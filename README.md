## 🔄 Steps Followed

### Step 1: Created 5 Passwords with Varying Complexity

| Password          | Complexity Level        | Expected Strength     |
|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| `123456`          | Digits only             | ❌ Very Weak           |
| `password123`     | Dictionary word + digit | ❌ Weak                |
| `P@ssw0rd`        | Mixed case + symbol     | ⚠️ Medium              |
| `V!brant_SkY2024` | Mixed + longer length   | ✅ Strong              |
| `tG$9vZ#1m@P!`    | Random + high entropy   | ✅ Very Strong         |

### Step 2: Evaluated Passwords on 3 Different Tools

#### ✅ PasswordMeter Feedback:
- Scores based on length, complexity, and dictionary use
- Weak passwords flagged for lack of variation

#### ✅ HowSecureIsMyPassword:
- Estimated time to crack (e.g., `tG$9vZ#1m@P!` = "centuries")
- `123456` cracked in less than 1 second

#### ✅ NordPass Checker:
- Identified if password is common/leaked in breaches
- Rated `123456` as "Very weak – found in 1000+ data breaches"
- Rated `V!brant_SkY2024` and `tG$9vZ#1m@P!` as "Strong – safe to use"

## 📊 Password Strength Summary

| Password          | Strength Result (General)     | Cracking Time (Est.)       |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `123456`          | Very Weak                     | < 1 second                  |
| `password123`     | Weak                          | Few seconds                 |
| `P@ssw0rd`        | Medium                        | Few minutes                 |
| `V!brant_SkY2024` | Strong                        | Several years               |
| `tG$9vZ#1m@P!`    | Very Strong                   | Centuries (theoretical)     |

## ✅ Tips Learned for Creating Strong Passwords

- Use **12–16 characters or more**
- Mix **uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols**
- Avoid **common patterns**, **dictionary words**, and **personal info**
- Don’t reuse passwords across multiple sites
- Random and long = secure

## ⚠️ Examples of Common Weak Passwords

| Password      | Reason                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `123456`      | Numeric, short, widely used   |
| `qwerty`      | Keyboard pattern              |
| `password`    | Dictionary word               |
| `admin123`    | Common default combo          |
| `letmein`     | Common phrase                 |

## 🛡️ Common Password Attacks (Researched)

| Attack Type          | Description                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**      | Tries all combinations until one matches                 |
| **Dictionary Attack**| Uses common words/passwords from pre-built lists         |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Reuses stolen credentials from other sites            |

## 🧠 Conclusion

Using multiple password strength tools (PasswordMeter, NordPass, and HowSecureIsMyPassword), I confirmed that **password complexity significantly increases security**.  
Simple passwords are cracked instantly; long, random ones can resist even brute force attacks for centuries.
